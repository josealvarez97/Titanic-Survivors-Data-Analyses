# Titanic-Survivors-Data-Analyses
Statistical analyses (e.g., significance tests, Bayesian inferences, etc.) performed in a data set containing information about the passengers in the Titanic disaster of 1912. Data set from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

**This is a college assignment finished in the spring of 2018, during my freshman year at [Minerva Schools at KGI](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu), that I have made public. Any changes since then have been performed mainly for improving the presentation.**



# Outline

* The **[report](/Report/ReportDraft.pdf)** is a condensed version of the original paper submitted back in the Spring of 2018, as part of a required college assignment. It is the best description of the statistical analyses that I performed.

* **[Appendix A](Appendix%20A%20-%20Computations%20and%20Data%20Analyses%20(Jupyter%20Notebooks))** contains the code I wrote to compute the statistical analyses. There are many explanatory comments and graphs on each of the different Jupyter Notebooks. More specifically:
  * [ConditionalProbability-PassgersSurvival-ByClassAndAge.ipynb](Appendix%20A%20-%20Computations%20and%20Data%20Analyses%20(Jupyter%20Notebooks)/ConditionalProbability-PassgersSurvival-ByClassAndAge.ipynb) applies Bayesian Inference methods to determine the probability of survival of passengers given class and age.
  * [Mean-Age-Of-Children-Groups-Estimation.ipynb](Mean-Age-Of-Children-Groups-Estimation.ipynb) contains computations for determining confidence intervals of the age of different children groups. 
  * [RandomBernoulliTrials-Distributions-ParentsAttemptsToSaveChildren.ipynb](RandomBernoulliTrials-Distributions-ParentsAttemptsToSaveChildren.ipynb) contains analyses that attempt to answer research questions such as "how many attempts do parents needed to save their children?" where an attempt is understood as having to ask for an escape route for one of their children. I aknowledge that strong assumptions are made and these are explained in the report.
  * [SignificanceTest-Of-Surviving-and-NonSuriving-ChildrenMeanAge-Difference.ipynb](Appendix%20A%20-%20Computations%20and%20Data%20Analyses%20(Jupyter%20Notebooks)/Mean-Age-Of-Children-Groups-Estimation.ipynb) I ran significance test on various research hypotheses. This was one of the main features of the assignment.
* Others folders are of relative less importance (e.g., *data*, *Appendix J - Playing with the data and some junk*). But I aknowledge that they are there, for reference.
  
## Update:

I recall that I performed these analyses when I was a still a freshman in early 2018. I stand by my work, but I have gained new knowledge and improved the quality of my practices in each of my works since then. I hope to keep uploading new assignments, or any work, that I consider relevant to demonstrate that I have experience with particular technologies, methods, etc., and also evidence my new skills.
